# Nasumid AI Concierge Development Rules

## 1. Netlify Build & Deployment Config
* **Base Directory**: Must be configured as `Desktop/nasumid` in Netlify dashboard because the Git repository contains the nested directories.
* **netlify.toml Settings**:
  - `command = "npm run build"`
  - `publish = ".next"`
  - Plugin `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` must be enabled.

## 2. VOICEVOX & TTS Text Normalization
* VOICEVOX will **fail/crash** if it receives half-width alphabets (e.g. `TKG`), currency symbols (`¥`), or raw hyphens inside numbers.
* Always clean up text inside `/app/api/concierge/route.js` -> `optimizeTextForSpeech` before sending to TTS:
  - Convert `TKG` to `たまごかけごはん` (Natural Japanese).
  - Clean up `¥` and `,` (Commas) for prices.
  - Convert `・` (Middle dots) to `、` (Reading pause).

## 3. Mobile Responsive Layout for Avatar
* Mobile viewport styling (`@media (max-width: 768px)`) for `.ai-live-avatar` must explicitly declare `flex-shrink: 0 !important` and `min-width: 50px !important` to prevent the flexbox from squishing and disappearing the avatar.
